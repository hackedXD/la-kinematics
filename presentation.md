# Why Study Kinematics?

### Core Focus Areas

- **Forward Kinematics (FK):** Determine end-effector position from joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Find joint configurations for desired positions.

### Practical Importance

- Enables precise control of robotic arms.
- Foundation for designing manipulators.

---

# Kinematics Framework

### Variables of Interest

- **Joint values vector (θ):** Angles or displacements.
- **End-effector position (x):** Target location in workspace.

### The Two Key Problems

1. **FK:** Compute **x** from given **θ**.
2. **IK:** Solve for **θ** corresponding to desired **x**.

# Linear Transformations in Robotics

### Understanding Transformations

- **Rotation (θ):** Changes orientation.
- **Translation (d):** Accounts for offset distances.

### Homogeneous Transformation Matrices

- Combine rotation and translation into a single matrix.
- Represent a manipulator’s configuration as a sequence of transformations.

# Building a Forward Kinematics Model

### Example: 2R Manipulator

1. Two links, two joints.
2. Transformation sequence:
    - \( R(q_1), T(l_1), R(q_2), T(l_2) \).

### Resulting Transformation

- \( A(q, l) = R(q_1)T(l_1)R(q_2)T(l_2) \).
- Multiplied with the origin to get end-effector position.

# Analytical Forward Kinematics

### Step-by-Step Calculation

- Assign joint angles \( q_1, q_2 \).
- Use transformation matrices for each joint.
- Multiply matrices to get final configuration.

### Formula

- \( x = l_1\cos(q_1) + l_2\cos(q_1 + q_2) \)
- \( y = l_1\sin(q_1) + l_2\sin(q_1 + q_2) \)

# Inverse Kinematics Challenges

### Problem Statement

- Given **x**, solve for **θ**.

### Complexity

- Non-linear equations.
- Multiple or no solutions depending on reachability.

### Approaches

- **Analytical:** For simple systems like 2R.
- **Numerical:** Iterative algorithms for complex arms.
